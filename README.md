# Vale-Javascript-Practice

The objective of this project is to create a javascript front-end application that demonstrates fundamental functionality
as well as some more advanced topics such as asynchronous behaviour and intergration with a framework to support "Single-Page Application" functionality

Whilst not extensively covered, this project will use HTML & CSS to facilitate the structure of the webpage generated.

The project will also use the SpringBoot Java-based framework to provide a hosted server for both front-end and back-end operations. Forming the basis for a rudimentary fullstack application.
